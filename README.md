# Microsoft-Rewards-Script
Automated Microsoft Rewards script, however this time using TypeScript, Cheerio and Puppeteer.

Under development, however mainly for personal use!

## How to setup ##
1. Download or clone source code
2. Run `npm i` to install the packages
3. Change `accounts.example.json` to `accounts.json` and add your account details
4. Change `config.json` to your liking
5. Run `npm run build` to build the script
6. Run `npm run start` to start the built script

## Notes ##
- If you end the script without closing the browser window first (only with headless as false), you'll be left with hanging chrome instances using resources. Use taskmanager to kill these or use the included `npm run chrome-kill-win` script. (Windows)
- If you automate this script, set it to run at least 2 times a day to make sure it picked up all tasks, set `"runOnZeroPoints": false` so it doesn't run when no points are found.
